Projects acquired for courses

Projects I've done in the last three years. </br>
May be of help for undergraduates or programming beginners (hope they can be helpful).</br>

I've been in Japan as an exchange student for one year, so some of the descriptions use Japanese.</br>
Since the projects are not so difficult, I believe you can understand them without the Japanese descriptions.:)
