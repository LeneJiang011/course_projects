Projects acquired for courses

Projects I've done in the last three years. 
May be of help for undergraduates or programming beginners (hope they can be helpful).

I've been in Japan as an exchange student for one year, so some of the descriptions use Japanese.
Since the projects are not so difficult, I believe you can understand them without the Japanese descriptions.:)
