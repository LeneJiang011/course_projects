# Some instructions to use the files

##SimpleCalculator.java </br>
This program can perform functions like simple calculator(just like the name!) </br>
It includes simple operations considering priorities, clear operations, functions such as cosine, sine as well as square. </br>
Examples: If you input '3+8*2', the output will be '19'. If you input '4sqrt+2', the output will be '4'. </br>
Note: 
1. As for the functions, if you want to squre '4', then you should firstly press '4', then press 'sqrt'. </br>
   There are also some instructions indicating what you are doing in the consoling window. I'm sorry, but in Japanese. 
2. There is a strange discipline that you'd better obey. Well, in other words, some problem I haven't solved:(. It is that once you press      on '=',you should press on 'C' to normally perform another calculation. Otherwise there will be lines of words in red in the console        window.</br>
See the code for detail, I'm afraid my poor English can't explain them explicitly. (I'm trying, though...) </br>

##compositeTest</br>
If you have learnt some programming courses on Java, I bet you have acknowledged the concept of "Design Pattern". </br>
The three files together demonstrate a pattern named Composite Pattern. </br>
According to my own understanding, it is a patttern that you can have the same operation on all the composite elements through one interface.</br>
Of course there are other patterns, and I'm trying to find my codes...I'm afraid I forget to save them...

##UML modeling</br>
I have done kinds of UML modeling, but since they are not widely used now, I've decided not to upload them.</br>
If you want to see some silly works of a junior student, please contact me.</br>
By the way, I used UML Designer which is based on Eclipse. In some way it is convenient since it autonomously correlates class design with sequence diagram. But I have to say, the diagram is kind of...ugly. </br>
There are also some softwares like StarUML which can also be used to develop UML modeling, but I think the user interface as well as the buttons are too poorly-designed, which makes me considering that lines of codes are more beautiful than the diagrams.:(</br>

##Peer Programming</br>
I did the projects during my Software Design course, and in the last lesson I was lucky to work with my classmate Yuuko-san (I'm sorry, but I really don't know the pronunciation of her family name).</br>
During peer programming, we firstly tried to make some improvements to her codes. It really surprised me that the way she programmed differed greatly from me. </br>
Yuuko-san also couldn't understand why I coded my program in such a strange way. And we spent a lot of time figuring out why there were so many differences.</br>
It was not good for our progress, I have to say, and I was always thinking it was my fault since I was the only Chinese in that course. And I couldn't get rid of my previous programming habits which I formed in China.</br>
Anyway, it's a good experience for me and I just want to share with anyone who spare his/her precious time to read up here.

Thanks for reading. Hope you can have fun.
